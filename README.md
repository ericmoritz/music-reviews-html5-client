This is the HTML5 client for the [music-reviews-serivce](https://github.com/ericmoritz/music-reviews-service).

It is written using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Mock Service

In good hypermedia fashion, there is a mock service that can be navigated to. Just run the following:

```
npm install -g react-tools
make all
make demo
```

This will start an HTTP server here: http://127.0.0.1:9966/#mock_service/index.json

If you navigate to that URL you can use the service.
